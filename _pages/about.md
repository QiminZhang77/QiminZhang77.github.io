I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), supervised by Professor Mingfu Shao. I received my Master degree in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in 2019 and I got my Bachelor degree in Aircraft Airworthiness and Applied Mathematics (minor) from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2016. My CV is [here](http://QiminZhang77.github.io/files/QiminZhang_CV2024.pdf).

Research
======
My research interests lie in **algorithm design** and **machine learning**, and particularly their applications in healthcare and diagnostics. Also, I am interested in designing machine learning models for resource allocation in high throughput computing since I realized that many bioinformatics workflows consists of hundreds or thousands of tasks that vary from short serial tasks to very large parallel tasks. 

Currently I am working on **designing algorithms** and **developing softwares** for the following research topics:
- transcriptome assembly
- single-cell RNA-seq data analysis 

Software
======
Developed open-source software and tools, such as Scallop2, irtool and Aletsch, have **over 15,000 downloads** in Bioconda, and the number is actively increasing.

Open source software **Scallop2** is an improved reference-based transcriptome assembler that enables accurate assembly of transcriptomes at both single-cell resolution (with Smart-seq3 data) and bulk level (with Illumina paired-end data). Software is available at [github](https://github.com/Shao-Group/scallop2) and [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/scallop2). Scallop2 has been published at [Nature Computational Science](https://rdcu.be/cJ0Oa). 

Open source software **Aletsch** implements an efficient algorithm to assemble multiple RNA-seq samples (or multiple cells for single-cell RNA-seq data). Software is available at [github](https://github.com/Shao-Group/aletsch/) and [bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/aletsch). Alestch has been accepcted by ISMB 2024 and published at [Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/40/Supplement_1/i307/7700882?searchresult=1).
