I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am honored to be advised by [Dr. Mingfu Shao](https://sites.psu.edu/mxs2589/). I received my Master degree in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in 2019 and I got my Bachelor degree in Aircraft Airworthiness and Applied Mathematics (minor) from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2016. My CV is [here](http://QiminZhang77.github.io/files/cv.pdf).

Research
======
My research interests lie in algorithm design and machine learning, and particularly their applications in healthcare and medical diagnosis. Also, I am interested in designing machine learning models for resource allocation in high throughput computing since I realized that many bioinformatics workflows consists of hundreds or thousands of tasks that vary from short serial tasks to very large parallel tasks. Currently I am working on designing algorithms and developing softwares for the following research topics:
- transcriptome assembly
- single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
- assembly with spatial transcriptomic data 

Software
======
**Scallop2** is a reference-based transcriptome assembler that enables accurate assembly of transcriptomes at single-cell resolution (with Smart-seq3 data) and bulk level (with Illumina paired-end data). Software is available at [github](https://github.com/Shao-Group/scallop2) and developed using C++. Scallop2 has been published at [Nature Computational Science](https://rdcu.be/cJ0Oa).
