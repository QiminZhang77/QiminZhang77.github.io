I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am honored to be advised by [Dr. Mingfu Shao](https://sites.psu.edu/mxs2589/). I received my Master degree in Computer Technology from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) in 2019 and I got my Bachelor degree in Aircraft Airworthiness and Applied Mathematics (minor) from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/) in 2016.

My research interests lie in algorithm design and machine learning, and particularly their applications in healthcare and medical diagnosis. Currently I am working on designing algorithms and developing softwares for the following research topics:
- transcriptome assembly
- single-cell RNA-seq data analysis
- assembly with spatial transcriptomic data
