Work experience
======
  * **Senior Bioinformatics Specialist** \
  [Labcorp](https://www.labcorp.com/), July 2023 - present \
  remote, Pittsburgh, PA \
  **Roles & Projects:**
    - Developed computational methods and pipelines for virus subtyping and strain-level identification from the metagenomics samples
    - Developed and re-engineering the data structure and algorithms of tools and software to provides verbose log, improve accuracy, and reduce computational cost
    - Developed pipeline for metabolomic pathway prediction from microbiome sequencing data- using statistical and machine learning methods, focusing on the discovery of biomarkers related to women's health diseases.

  * **Data Science / Bioinformatics Summer Intern** \
  [Labcorp](https://www.labcorp.com/), May 2022 - Aug 2022 \
  remote, Pittsburgh, PA \
  **Roles & Projects:**
    - Predict gut metabolites from gut microbiome data using machine learning:
      + Developed highly accurate data pipelines to predict gut metabolites and metagenome functions from gut microbiome data
      + Explored combination of parameters of feature selection to increase accuracy
      + Managed to work on a Colorectal Cancer dataset and achieved all metabolites well predicted (using Spearman correlation coefficient as the metric)
    - AWS resource access control:
      + Developed a web application to enable the AWS resource access control and deployed to ECS
      + Developed on service end to create IAM roles to access AWS resource (S3 and DynamoDB)
      + Developed on front end to implement the user interface
